Hello! I'm **Ivan Ocampo**, a technology professional specializing in architecture, infrastructure, business improvement and design. In my current role as a solutions architect, I design and optimize systems that support growing, scalable and efficient business operations. This work leverages my extensive technical knowledge in programming, cloud platforms, and data analysis to create robust solutions tailored to organizational needs. I apply **TOGAF** principles to structure thisframework, ensuring a comprehensive and methodical approach.

In addition to my professional endeavors, I am pursuing a **PhD** where I explore **liminal spaces**: the transitional areas between different states or phases. My research delves into understanding these in-between spaces and their implications. Drawing from my technical background, I handle data processing, visualization, and analysis using a variety of tools:

- **Python:** Developed a language analysis project that examines linguistic patterns in transitional narratives, leveraging libraries such as NLTK and spaCy to extract and interpret meaningful insights. This was particularly useful throughout the Qualitative analysis.
- **R:** Created an application that assesses data cleanliness by evaluating missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers, providing actionable recommendations to improve data quality.
- **MATLAB:** Utilized MATLAB for advanced statistical modeling and visualization, including the development of custom scripts to simulate transitional dynamics and visualize complex datasets.
- **Apache Spark:** Implemented big data processing pipelines to manage and analyze large-scale datasets related to liminal phenomena, enhancing data throughput and computational efficiency.

Committed to continuous learning, I regularly update my skills through courses and hands-on projects. I iam studying **Machine Learning** with frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**.
