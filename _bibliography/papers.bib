  abstract={The first and second industrial revolutions were centred on industrial production factories and bureaucratic buildings as fundamental locations for employees to conduct their daily work. The third industrial revolution began to change this trend; in the last decades, the growth and popularity of technical innovations redesigned the work model, and organisations redirected their efforts to technological tools to replace manual processes. The advances and expansion of information and communication technologies and the accessibility to “any time, anywhere” work models have enabled employees to carry out work activities at remote and flexible locations. Perhaps most notably, flexible, remote and virtual work from home have become widely accepted and, at times, vital to maintaining and fostering organisational success. This trend, further fuelled by Covid-19, appears to be here to stay, hence leading to the question of how does it influence employee well-being?}

  abstract={The office environment plays a significant role in supporting employee satisfaction and mental well-being. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, work has been increasingly detached from place, and definitive design strategies for remote working and the home office are absent or vague and generalised, limiting their application. Research suggests that the three most critical needs in the workplace are (1) sociability with colleagues, (2) opportunity to grow, and (3) work-life balance. Remote working is often seen as an essential aspect of inclusivity for people with disabilities and characterised as a way forward to incorporate inclusion and diversity strategies within organisations. This paper challenges remote working as a gold-standard solution to enhancing well-being and employee satisfaction and highlights critical challenges, including obstruction to work-life balance, ineffective communication methods, and solitude. It further discusses the importance of workplace needs affected by remote work experiences, including sociability, support, and increased workload, and illustrates the criticality of employee self-discipline. Finally, this paper considers the COVID-19 pandemic as a time of extreme isolation and acknowledges the effect these unprecedented times have on a vulnerable population, and how it contributes to employees' feelings toward working from home.}
